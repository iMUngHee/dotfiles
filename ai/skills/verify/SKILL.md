Verify that the completed work actually achieves its goal.

Goal: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, infer from recent commits or ask)

## System — design's read-only post-step

verify is an **optional read-only step after implementation** — not a pm-* loop node (it owns no per-task artifact, so the canonical loop is unchanged). It consumes the **session-bound plan** that `design` writes and `retro` later reads, using its `## Verifiable Success Criteria` as truth conditions (Step 1). It **persists nothing** and changes no status — confirming the goal is met is verify's job; closing the loop (plan→terminal, item→`closed.md`) stays `retro`'s. With `grill` (design's read-only pre-step) it forms the two read-only satellites bracketing `design`. Outside the loop (no explicit or session-bound plan) it just verifies a goal.

## Current Context
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null || echo "N/A"`
- Changed files: !`git diff --stat HEAD~5 2>/dev/null || echo "N/A"`

## Plan delta (optional)

Resolve an explicitly supplied plan with `resolve-plan`; otherwise resolve the originating
session through the shared read-only engine using exact injected metadata:

```bash
root="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" || exit 1
PM_SESSION_TOOL="<injected session tool>" PM_SESSION_ID="<exact injected session id>" node "$HOME/.config/ai/lib/worktree.mjs" resolve-session --root "$root" --tool "<injected session tool>"
```

`status: ok` supplies `plan`, immutable `base_commit`, `branch`, and `execution_root`.
Re-root every file, Git, and test command there. Any routing or mapping error blocks
verification with the engine output as evidence; never fall back to the caller checkout.

If found, compare planned vs actual:
- **Planned files**: `files_affected` from plan frontmatter
- **Actual files**: `git -C <execution_root> diff --name-only <base_commit>...HEAD`
- Report delta as informational (files added/removed vs plan). Do NOT block on delta — plans evolve during implementation.

If the session is unbound, do not inspect main launcher state. Use an explicit plan/goal
when supplied; otherwise skip this section entirely.

## Optional acceleration — `verifier` subagent

**All verification runs inline by default** — including 5+ truth conditions and Level 3/4 depth. The steps below are self-contained; you never *need* a subagent, and there is no loss of coverage when running inline.

As an **optional** speed-up, if a `verifier` subagent is installed in your environment you may offload broad verification to it purely to keep the main context clean — useful when verification would otherwise read many files or run a long test suite (goal spans multiple modules, Level 3/4 grep across 10+ files, etc.):
- **Claude Code**: `Agent(subagent_type: "verifier", description: "<short>", prompt: "Goal: <...>. Depth: <1-4>. Plan path: <optional>. Changed files: <optional>.")` — **only if that agent is present** (pm-skills does not bundle it).
- **Codex CLI**: spawn a `codex exec` subprocess with the same focused prompt (Goal / Depth / Plan path / Changed files).

If no such agent is available, run every step inline — that is the default path. When you do dispatch, pass the plan path so the agent seeds truth conditions from the plan's `## Verifiable Success Criteria` (same as inline Step 1), and return its report directly — do NOT re-run checks inline after dispatch.

## Approach: Goal-backward

Do NOT check "were tasks completed." Instead ask:
"What must be TRUE for this goal to be achieved?" — then verify each condition.

## Steps

### 1. Derive truth conditions

If the Plan delta step found a plan with a `## Verifiable Success Criteria` section (written by `/design`), use those conditions as the truth conditions — that section is `/design`'s seed for exactly this step. Otherwise derive them: from the goal, list 3-7 concrete conditions that MUST be true.
Format:

```
Truth conditions for: [goal]
- [ ] [condition 1]
- [ ] [condition 2]
...
```

### 2. Verify each condition at appropriate depth

For each condition, apply verification levels based on scope:

**Level 1 — Exists**: file, function, route, config entry is present.
```bash
# Example: check function exists
grep -rn "function handleAuth" src/
```

**Level 2 — Substantive**: not a stub or placeholder.
Scan for stub patterns: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `NotImplementedError`,
`throw new Error('not implemented')`, empty function bodies, `pass`.
```bash
# Example: check for stubs in new files
grep -n "TODO\|FIXME\|NotImplementedError" <file>
```

**Level 3 — Wired**: connected to the rest of the codebase.
Imported, called, routed, registered — not orphaned code.
```bash
# Example: check if new module is imported anywhere
grep -rn "import.*handleAuth\|require.*handleAuth" src/
```

**Level 4 — Flowing**: actual data flows through it.
Run the code, show real output.
```bash
# Example: run the feature, show output
npm test -- --grep "auth"
```

### 3. Determine depth per condition

| Change scope | Required levels |
|---|---|
| Single function edit | 1 (Exists) + 2 (Substantive) |
| Feature complete | + 3 (Wired) |
| PR-ready / release | + 4 (Flowing) |

If unsure about scope, default to all 4 levels.

### 4. Report

Update the checklist from Step 1 with results:

```
Truth conditions for: [goal]
- [x] [condition 1] — Level 3 verified: [evidence]
- [ ] [condition 2] — FAILED at Level 2: stub found at file:line
...

Verdict: X/Y conditions verified
```

Each condition MUST have a fenced code block showing the verification output.
Failed conditions — report to the user with specific failure point.

## Rules

- Never mark a condition as verified without showing evidence
- If a condition fails, do NOT fix it silently — report the failure
- Stub detection is mandatory for Level 2 (grep for patterns above)
- This skill verifies. It does not modify code.
